# Emotion-drift-analysis-using-AI

A web-based AI system for **emotion analysis and monitoring** that combines **interpersonal text emotion analysis** with **individual facial emotion tracking**, designed for both **internship-level evaluation** and **product-style demos**.

This project is built with a clear separation of concerns, ethical safeguards, and explainable AI principles.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Human emotions are complex and rarely expressed through a single channel. Text alone often hides emotional intent, while facial cues reveal affective states but lack context. This system addresses that gap by designing **two parallel emotion pipelines** that meet only at the analytics layer.

### Core Idea

* **Text Emotion** → What is being expressed in conversations
* **Face Emotion** → What the individual is experiencing internally
* **Fusion** → Long-term patterns and alignment, not instant judgments

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Chat Emotion Analysis

* Text-only emotion detection
* Designed for analyzing conversations with other people
* Handles informal language and mixed sentiment
* Stored for long-term trend analysis

### 2. Self Emotion Monitoring

* Webcam-based **snapshot capture** (not continuous streaming)
* Individual emotion detection using facial cues
* Explicit user consent and camera toggles
* Emotion logs stored with timestamps

### 3. Emotion Dashboard

* Timeline view of emotional states
* Emotion distribution over selected time ranges
* Confidence-weighted trends
* Emotional drift detection

### 4. Late Fusion Analytics

* Text and face emotions are **never fused at capture time**
* Fusion occurs at the analytics layer using historical data
* Enables detection of:

  * Emotional suppression
  * Emotional alignment/misalignment
  * Stability vs volatility

---

## 🧪 Fusion Strategy (Explainable AI)

This system uses **Late Fusion**, not early embedding fusion.

Why?

* Models remain independent and debuggable
* Easier to explain in interviews and evaluations
* Allows re-analysis as models improve

### Example Insight

> Facial sadness increased over time while chat sentiment remained neutral → possible emotional masking detected.

This is presented as an **observed pattern**, not a psychological diagnosis.

---

## 🗄️ Data Storage Design

### Face Emotion Log Schema

```
id | user_id | emotion | confidence | timestamp
```

### Why this matters

* Enables time-series analysis
* Supports drift detection
* Allows future reprocessing with improved models

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Privacy

* Webcam is **OFF by default**
* Explicit user consent required
* Snapshot-based capture only
* No background recording
* UI uses phrases like:

  * "Observed emotional indicators"
  * "Detected patterns"

This avoids false certainty and ethical overreach.

   * Snapshot-based facial emotion capture
   * Emotion and confidence displayed instantly
   * Data stored for historical analysis
   * ![Self Emotion Detection](screenshots/Screenshot%2026-02-09%20142855.png)


3. **Dashboard & Insights**

   * Emotion timeline and distribution graphs
   * Drift and stability indicators
   * High-level fused emotional insights
   * ![Dashboard](screenshots/Screenshot%2026-02-09%20142827.png)
   * ![Timeline](screenshots/Screenshot%2026-02-09%20142839.png)

4. **Support & Safety Insights**
   
   * Access via the shield icon 🛡️ in the dashboard
   * View non-clinical severity assessment (Low/Medium/High)
   * Access Tele-MANAS helpline details directly
   * Find nearby psychologists (requires manual consent)

This flow demonstrates **real-time inference**, **ethical design**, and **long-term analytics** in under three minutes.

## 🛡️ Emotional Risk Awareness & Support

This system includes a **Support & Safety Layer** designed to analyze long-term emotional health indicators without making medical diagnoses.

### Pattern Recognition (Not Diagnosis)
The system calculates "Severity Levels" based purely on mathematical drift and volatility:
*   **Low**: Normal emotional fluctuations.
*   **Medium**: Sustained negative drift.
*   **High**: Sustained drift + high volatility.

### Support Resources
If high emotional risk patterns are detected, the system provides:
*   **Tele-MANAS Helpline**: Direct display of India's 24x7 Mental Health Helpline (14416).
*   **Psychologist Finder**: (Optional) Consent-based lookup for nearby professionals.
*   **Coping Guidance**: Static, non-prescriptive suggestions for seeking human support.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

* Facial emotion detection is probabilistic and culturally sensitive
* Not a diagnostic or clinical system
* Accuracy depends on lighting and camera quality

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Multimodal audio emotion analysis
* Personal baseline calibration
* On-device inference
* Cross-cultural emotion modeling
